WHERE I'M AT
-have changed API so width of grout is width in tiles
-need to fix problem with legacy render mode (for Blood Funnel)
-need to get rid of tile width option in wave toy or make it work

got to change how it all works

create temp pixel map
change draw_all so it stamps everything onto one temp pixel map
render pixel map
draw









-make it so all attributes can be set using param hash

draw all should take group as optional arg
mod delete_sprite function to delete from group


-have it go faster as you go along
-center piece when put into play

-add way to shift pixels (like real pixels for scrolling)

-can we stick reference to groutris in document rather than document AND canvas?

test multiple animation loops (w two grouts)

-change pixel to tile

High:
-have grout create canvas tag itself (with optional override)
-make sure var scopes are legit

Medium:
-shorthand way of setting maps (set up color pallette then use letters)
  -pallette could be hash of alphanumeric characters
  -then set to string ignoring whitespace
-multiple animation loops
-make sure pixel positions works when screen is scrolled

Low:
-design way to mess with draw functionality
-make demo game
-handle events other than clicks
