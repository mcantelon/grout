Notes to myself?

High:
-have grout create canvas tag itself (with optional override)
-make var scope is legit
-add pixel map class (one or more maps in a Grout)

Medium:
-shorthand way of setting maps (set up color pallette then use letters)
  -pallette could be hash of alphanumeric characters
  -then set to string ignoring whitespace
-multiple animation loops
-make sure pixel positions works when screen is scrolled

Low:
-design way to mess with draw functionality
-make demo game
-handle events other than clicks
